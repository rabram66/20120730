- Soft private beta on Saturday, December 9

TODOs
--------------------------
- Come up with strategy/architecture for managing tweets

WebSite Enhancements
--------------------
- Separate the public-facing aspects of LocationController into its own controller (e.g. #index, #details, and various XHR actions)

Programming Suggestions:
-----------------------
- Move role handling into something like Can-Can
  - Administrator (register)
  - Promoter (events)
  - Consumer (unauthenticated)
  - Consumer (authenticated/personalization)

Features to consider:
---------------------
- Show deals and events on details page? 
 - Investigate how to do this
   - (matching deals to name? or more explicit tie-ins?)
- Events tied to Location
- Consider events pulled from EventBrite and Facebook Events
