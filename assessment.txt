General Issues
--------------
1. Problem with oDesk screenshots (still working to resolve)
DONE: 2. Have not deployed to Heroku lately due to major mods; but needs to be done
3. Problems after deployment need to be monitored
  3.1 We should consider something like GetExceptional or Airbrake

- LocationsController is too fat (too much logic in #index)
  BS: This is being improved by me
  BS: iPhone controller suffers from same bloat; it will be refactored once LocationsController is done (within reason)
  BS: On a related note; there may not be a need for a separate iPhone controller; its possible that the locations controller could be made to handle this
  BS: I suggest separating the public-facing aspects of LocationController into its own controller (e.g. #index, #details, and various XHR actions)
  
- Development database should be PostgreSQL
  BS: I mentioned this to Khanh but have not had a response; I will reach out to him again
  
- Please explain the get_general_types function in LocationsController; why are all the event types listed here; but, for place searches, only a subset is requested
  - TODO: Remove the get_general_types function and use the LocationCategory
  - TODO: Display improved 'types' drop-down on Location input form

Programming Suggestions:
-----------------------
- Move role handling into something like Can-Can
  - Administrator (register)
  - Promoter (events)
  - Consumer (unauthenticated)
  - Consumer (authenticated/personalization)

New Questions:
-------------
- How is ad tracking supposed to work? Why the crazy ad tracking behavior in the #details action? (Basically -- creation of 2 tracking records)
In addition, what if we (as we should) implement caching? Server-side ad tracking than will not work
  - Remove ad tracking

- What is newstuffs?
  - Remove

- When a Location is deleted, the corresponding Place record is not deleted. Should it be?


Features to consider:
---------------------
- Show deals and events on details page? 
 - Investigate how to do this
   - (matching deals to name? or more explicit tie-ins?)
 - Events tied to Location
- Consider events pulling from EventBrite and Facebook Events
