- Soft private beta on Saturday, December 9

WebSite Enhancements
--------------------
- Investigate filtering out retweets of retweets (improve signal-to-noise ratio)
- Problems after deployment need to be monitored
  - We should consider something like GetExceptional or Airbrake
    - Get Khanh to transfer Heroku ownership to Ray
    - Get Ray to add Airbrake add-on
    - Get Ray to add Memcache add-on
- LocationsController is too fat (too much logic in #index)
  BS: iPhone controller suffers from same bloat; it will be refactored once LocationsController is done (within reason)
  BS: On a related note; there may not be a need for a separate iPhone controller; its possible that the locations controller could be made to handle this
  BS: I suggest separating the public-facing aspects of LocationController into its own controller (e.g. #index, #details, and various XHR actions)
  
- Development database should be PostgreSQL
  BS: I mentioned this to Khanh but have not had a response; I will reach out to him again

Programming Suggestions:
-----------------------
- Move role handling into something like Can-Can
  - Administrator (register)
  - Promoter (events)
  - Consumer (unauthenticated)
  - Consumer (authenticated/personalization)

Features to consider:
---------------------
- Show deals and events on details page? 
 - Investigate how to do this
   - (matching deals to name? or more explicit tie-ins?)
 - Events tied to Location
- Consider events pulled from EventBrite and Facebook Events
