Mobile Interface
-----------------
- FIXED: Investigate case where page "repeats"
- FIXED: &quot in tweets

WebSite Enhancements
--------------------
- FIXED: Delete the place when the Location is deleted
- FIXED: Add application header (but not search bar) to top of details page
- Fixed height on tweet column to match map height
- Pagination (up to 100 tweets)
- Investigate limiting retweets (improve signal-to-noise ratio)
- ?? Get map to center on point B (maybe move?) (is this still an issue w/o the info bubble)
- N/A: Time ago for tweet in map bubble on details (tweet moved to top of page)
- JavaScript for ad needs to add geographic targeting
- Add highlight to listing with recent tweet
  - "Recent" defined as within the last day
- Soft private beta on Saturday


General Issues
--------------
1. Problem with oDesk screenshots (still working to resolve)
DONE: 2. Have not deployed to Heroku lately due to major mods; but needs to be done
3. Problems after deployment need to be monitored
  3.1 We should consider something like GetExceptional or Airbrake

- LocationsController is too fat (too much logic in #index)
  BS: This is being improved by me
  BS: iPhone controller suffers from same bloat; it will be refactored once LocationsController is done (within reason)
  BS: On a related note; there may not be a need for a separate iPhone controller; its possible that the locations controller could be made to handle this
  BS: I suggest separating the public-facing aspects of LocationController into its own controller (e.g. #index, #details, and various XHR actions)
  
- Development database should be PostgreSQL
  BS: I mentioned this to Khanh but have not had a response; I will reach out to him again
  
- Please explain the get_general_types function in LocationsController; why are all the event types listed here; but, for place searches, only a subset is requested
  - TODO: Remove the get_general_types function and use the LocationCategory
  - TODO: Display improved 'types' drop-down on Location input form

Programming Suggestions:
-----------------------
- Move role handling into something like Can-Can
  - Administrator (register)
  - Promoter (events)
  - Consumer (unauthenticated)
  - Consumer (authenticated/personalization)

Features to consider:
---------------------
- Show deals and events on details page? 
 - Investigate how to do this
   - (matching deals to name? or more explicit tie-ins?)
 - Events tied to Location
- Consider events pulled from EventBrite and Facebook Events
